Association:

Interest: Used to determine if the association is interesting enough to consider.

Marks: Permanent Associations

-markThreshold: If interest is above, association becomes Mark
-objMarkThreshold: Makes objects unique. 

Associations (Polarity <Good or Bad>, Strength <How strong the emotional response is>, Exhaustive Multiplier <How fast should the emotion exhaust on repeated feeling>)



Personality:
associator: All assocations for the personality.
seenEvents: 
-[0]: List of strings 
--[0] Subject
--[1] Verb
--[2] Object

-[1]: List of floats
--[0]: Interest for event
--[1]: Polarity of event
--[2]:Interaction
--[3]: How many times the event has been accessed.

div: The divider for multiple accesses

Perceive:
-String info:
--[0] = Subj
--[1] = Verb
--[2] = Obj
interaction: 
-[0]: Polarity
-[1]: Associative Strength

Feel: 
-string[] info: Same as perceive, but for one.
-div: Same div from ealier
-opine: 
--If True: Just deliver opinion
--If False: Also input to personality.
-This is where the recursive associations occur. 
--Go into assocations
--Check ID to associator 
--Determine if it is a mood or not
---If not, progress deeper
---If so, work from there. Go up.


-Called at some point in Perceive:
-Handles much of seenEvents
-Add div to number of accesses directly in association. 



CheckAssoc:
--1. Check prior value. If above mark threshold, skip 3.
--2. Adds interaction strength to Association
--3. Call GetMarks
